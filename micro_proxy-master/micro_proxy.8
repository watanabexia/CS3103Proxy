.SH NAME
micro_proxy - really small HTTP/HTTPS proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B micro_proxy
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I micro_proxy
is a very small HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
It runs from inetd, which means its performance is poor.
But for low-traffic sites, it's quite adequate.
It implements all the basic features of an HTTP/HTTPS proxy,
in only 260 lines of code.
.PP
To install it, add a line like this to /etc/inetd.conf:
.nf
    webproxy  stream tcp nowait nobody  /usr/local/sbin/micro_proxy micro_proxy
.fi
Make sure the path to the executable is correct.
Then add a line like this to /etc/services:
.nf
    webproxy   port/tcp
.fi
Change "port" to the port number you want to use - 3128, or whatever.
Then restart inetd by sending it a "HUP" signal, or rebooting.
.PP
On some systems, inetd has a maximum spawn rate - if you try to run
inetd services faster than a certain number of times per minute, it
assumed there's either a bug of an attack going on and it shuts down
for a few minutes.
If you run into this problem - look for syslog messages about too-rapid
looping - you'll need to find out how to increase the limit.
Unfortunately this varies from OS to OS.
On FreeBSD, you add a "-R 10000" flag to inetd's initial command line.
On some Linux systems, you can set the limit on a per-service basis
in inetd.conf, by changing "nowait" to "nowait.10000".
